## Video 1: AI FAKE - Obama Deepfake PSA (BuzzFeed)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Title | "You Won't Believe What Obama Says In This Video!" |
| Duration | ~1 minute |
| Created by | Jordan Peele + BuzzFeed (2018) |
| Platform | YouTube |

**What it shows:**
An AI-generated deepfake of Barack Obama speaking - created using Adobe After Effects and FakeApp AI. The video deliberately reveals itself as fake partway through, showing Jordan Peele alongside the fake Obama to demonstrate the technology.

**Why it works for your presentation:**
- Shows actual deepfake technology in action
- Self-reveals as fake (educational, not deceptive)
- High production quality
- Widely used in educational/media literacy contexts
- Clear demonstration of AI manipulation

## Video 2: REAL - BBC Verification of Cameroon Footage

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Title | BBC Africa Eye investigation - Anatomy of a Killing |
| Duration | Full documentary ~10 min (use opening segment) |
| Created by | BBC Africa Eye / BBC Verify |
| Platform | BBC / YouTube |

**What it shows:**
When a disturbing video emerged showing soldiers executing civilians in Cameroon, the government dismissed it as "fake news." BBC journalists used verification techniques (Google Earth, metadata analysis, uniform identification) to prove the footage was authentic and identify the perpetrators.

**Why it works for your presentation:**
- Direct contrast: government claimed "fake" but BBC proved REAL
- Shows professional verification process
- International subject matter
- Demonstrates real journalism vs disinformation claims
- High impact, credible source

## Suggested Presentation Flow

1. **Play Video 1 (Fake)** - Let audience think it's real Obama until reveal
2. **Play Video 2 (Real)** - Show how real footage can be falsely labelled "fake"
3. **Discussion point:** The challenge works both ways - fake looks real, real gets called fake
