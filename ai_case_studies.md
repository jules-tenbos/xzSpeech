## Key Themes & Lessons

### When AI Works Well:
1. **Clear, structured content** (technical docs, educational material)
2. **Human oversight maintained** (AI as tool, not replacement)
3. **Low-stakes or easily verifiable** contexts
4. **Scale advantages** (personalizing for millions)
5. **Data-driven insights** combined with human creativity
6. **Technical tasks** (metadata, pattern recognition)

### When AI Fails:
1. **High-stakes contexts** (legal, medical, security)
2. **Nuanced cultural content** (humor, idioms, emotional resonance)
3. **Over-reliance without human review**
4. **Complex social/political contexts**
5. **Creative work requiring authenticity**
6. **Building trust and emotional connection**

### The Integration Imperative:
- **Best results:** AI power + human creativity + cross-cultural sensitivity
- **Worst results:** Technology deployed alone without cultural understanding

## Notes for "Winning the Global Narrative in the AI Era" Talk

**Key Narrative Arc:**
1. AI offers unprecedented scale and speed for global communication
2. But real-world failures show dangers of over-reliance
3. Success requires integrating AI with human insight and cultural sensitivity
4. International communication theories remain essential guides
5. Future: AI as partner, guided by human wisdom

**Compelling Story Structure:**
- Start with dramatic failure (Facebook arrest) → human cost visible
- Show the scale of the challenge (4.5B translations/day)
- Present successes (MrBeast, Unilever) → demonstrate potential
- Reveal pattern: success = AI + human oversight + cultural understanding
- End with call to action: integrate technology with humanity

**Cultural Dimensions:**
- Global trust gap (China 83% vs US 39% optimism)
- Western-centric AI ethics need diversification
- 118 countries left out of AI governance
- Opportunity for Chinese communication scholarship to contribute frameworks

**Practical Takeaways:**
- AI is tool, not solution
- Cultural nuance still requires human judgment
- Scale + sensitivity = winning combination
- Ethics and responsibility non-negotiable
- Cross-border dialogue essential
