## Recommendations for Talk Presentation

### Most Impactful Video Clips:

1. **Hayao Miyazaki Interview** - Powerful emotional response, shows human cost
2. **Coca-Cola AI Commercial** - Shows corporate AI failure, side-by-side with 1995 original
3. **Xinhua AI News Anchor** - Demonstrates "uncanny valley" effect, includes BBC mockery
4. **MrBeast Dubbing** - Clear success story with before/after comparison
5. **India Elections Deepfakes** - Shows scale and variety of AI use
6. **Pope Francis Balenciaga** - Iconic "wake-up call" moment (still image but very recognizable)

### Video Sequence Suggestion for Talk:

**Opening:** Miyazaki clip → human emotional reaction to AI
**Problem:** Coca-Cola backlash → corporate misstep
**Scale:** Facebook statistics → billions of translations daily
**Manipulation:** India deepfakes or Russian propaganda
**Success:** MrBeast → AI enabling global reach
**Closing:** Return to human element
